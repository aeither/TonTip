- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and glass morphism effects
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TanStack Start** for full-stack React framework

### Blockchain
- **TON Blockchain** for decentralized infrastructure
- **Tact Language** for smart contract development
- **@ton/core** and **@ton/ton** for blockchain interactions
- **TonConnect** for wallet integration
- **@tonconnect/ui-react** for React wallet components

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Jest** for testing smart contracts
- **BluePrint** for TON development workflow
- **ngrok** for local development with Telegram WebApp

### Infrastructure
- **Telegram Bot API** for Mini App hosting
- **Telegram WebApp SDK** for platform integration
- **Node.js polyfills** for browser compatibility

## How we built it

### Smart Contract Development
1. **Reward Contract**: Built a TON smart contract using Tact language that handles:
   - User deposits
   - Reward distribution (0.01 TON per quiz)
   - Owner withdrawal functionality
   - Secure transaction validation

2. **HelloWorld Contract**: Created a simple counter contract for testing blockchain interactions

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Component Structure**: Organized React components for:
   - Quiz taking interface
   - Wallet connection
   - Reward claiming
   - Progress tracking

2. **State Management**: Implemented local state management for:
   - Quiz progress
   - User wallet connection
   - Transaction status
   - UI state

3. **Routing**: Used TanStack Router for seamless navigation between:
   - Home page with quiz selection
   - Quiz taking interface
   - Reward claiming page
   - Contract interaction pages

### Telegram Integration
1. **WebApp Setup**: Configured Telegram Mini App with proper manifest and HTTPS
2. **Wallet Integration**: Implemented TonConnect for seamless wallet connections
3. **UI Adaptation**: Designed responsive interface optimized for mobile Telegram usage

### Testing & Deployment
1. **Smart Contract Testing**: Comprehensive Jest tests for all contract functionality
2. **Frontend Testing**: Component testing and integration testing
3. **Local Development**: ngrok setup for testing Telegram WebApp functionality
